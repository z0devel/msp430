# MSP430 Sample code
Collection of MSP430 Sample Code, mainly bare-metal code.<br>
Some of the examples are based on TI existing examples, other are newly created from scratch.<br>
* Single file self-contained code samples
* They have been testes on CodeComposerStudio(CCS), although they should work on any environment
* They have been tested in Olimexino-5510 board and other custom boards based on the MSP430F5510
